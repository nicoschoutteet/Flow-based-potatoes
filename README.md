# Flow-based-potatoes
This repository contains the R code, functions and figures that were used for the post ["Slicing 14-dimensional potatoes: a visualization of the Core flow-based domain"](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/slicing-12-dimensional-potatoes-visualization-core-nico-schoutteet/) on LinkedIn, published in Nov. 2022.

Two files contain helper functions (one to download the data, one to transform the downloaded data and visualize them into flow-based domains):
- "helper functions - download.R"
- "helper functions - visualization.R"

Three files contain the code for the figures:
- "Core map.R"
- "domains.R"
- "raster.R"

While the figures themselves are listed in the subdirectory [Images](images/).
